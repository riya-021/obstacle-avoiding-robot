# Obstacle Avoiding Robot using Ultrasonic Sensors and Arduino

This project implements an **autonomous robot car** that uses **ultrasonic distance sensing (HC-SR04)** and a **servo-mounted front sensor** to detect and avoid obstacles in its path.

Built using **Arduino**, **DC motors**, **ultrasonic sensors**, and a **servo motor**, the robot intelligently maneuvers by analyzing distance and depth data.

## Features

- Automatic forward movement when path is clear
- Stops when an obstacle is detected
- Scans left and right using a servo to find an alternate path
- Backs up and turns if stuck
- Dual ultrasonic sensors â€” one for front distance, one for depth (optional)
